			<h1>Experiment 2 - Vector Art, Animation & Interactivity</h1>
			<div class="minor-section">
				<h2>Imitate</h2>
				<p>After looking through class examples and on OpenProcessing, I came up with the idea of making something
					related to food. That's when I thought of creating a project that simulates coffee art. I found a great example
					of a paint style that I thought would be really good in simulating milk foam. I also found another tutorial that
					would help with creating a pouring effect to add coffee into the cup.
				</p>
			</div>

			<div class="minor-section">
				<h2>Integrate</h2>
				<p>Using those resources, I began trying to implement my coffee cup. First I drew the base of the cup with shapes. This 
					was much harder than anticipated because I had to translate and rotate the handle in order to get it into the position 
					I want it to be. But because I used translate/rotation, I had to undo the translation so that the other objects weren't affected by it.
					After creating the coffee cup, I first implemented the coffee art simulator. I did this by adding in the brush affect and then
					restricted the user so they could only draw in the coffee portion. I also added in a pouring coffee portion which utilizes 
					a growing/expanding circle that fills all the way until the rim of the cup. After adding these, I had to figure out how 
					to separate these two steps by using buttons.
				</p>
			</div>

			<div class="minor-section">
				<h2>Innovate</h2>
				<p>Through buttons, I wanted to split each step so you had to fill up the cup with coffee first and then you could add sugar and 
					milk. It was rather complicated because I had to check if the cup was full or not and also make sure that the other buttons were 
					restricted and couldn't be used while another function is happening. After I got the buttons sorted out, I thought it would make the 
					process even more complete if I added a sugar element. This was when I came upon a particle emitter effect that I thought would be
					perfect for simulating the action of sprinkling sugar. Although I did encounter a few issues with implementing the effect, I eventually
					resolved all the issues and it turned out much better than I anticipated. I really love how my final product turned out because I feel 
					like I accomplished a lot more than I expected and also as my first time using p5.js, I think I was able to learn a lot from this assignment.
				</p>
			</div>

			<div class="minor-section">
				<h2>Reflection</h2>
				<p>I'm really proud of what I was able to accomplish. I did this assignment completley on my own and it was also my first time using p5.js 
					so I think the assignment turned out pretty well. I did bump into a lot of errors but I eventually fixed them and figured out what this library 
					has to offer as well as what elements it can be rather restricting in.
